## About Us

- Delfino Florentino Barajas

Landscape design has been a passion of mine since I arrived in the United States in 1991. My journey began as a regular employee at a landscaping company, but I always knew that landscaping was something I was not only passionate about but also skilled at. I decided to take the leap and start my own business, DFB Landscape. Here, we are dedicated to our craft and strive not just to meet your expectations, but to exceed them—caring for your needs and, most importantly, your home.
